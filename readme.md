#Scraping the secondary concert ticket market: Phish New Year's Tour tickets on Stubhub

Perhaps people with **nerdlike obsessions** gravitate towards the arcane. Or maybe those who are drawn into arcane interests tend to be more obsessive. Music, particularly music of improvisatory nature, such as the **Grateful Dead** or the bands of **Miles Davis** and **John Coltrane**, and music of literary or experimental nature, such as **Bob Dylan**, **Leonard Cohen**, **Sun Ra**, **Ornette Coleman**, etc., draws in the obsessive. If you've read of those transcribing 10 minute+ Coltrane solos you'll have glimpsed into this world. If you've ever seen a stack of cassette tapes with hand-written dates of shows organized chronilogically with unique characters (*,^,%,$,etc.) denoting song teases (melodic or lyrical gestures to sounds outside of the song currenlty being played) or special guests joining in on a performance, you've seen this world.  

In stark contrast to the band and perhaps the lore of partying too hard throughout the scene, around the **Grateful Dead** there were [engineers and scientists](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/grateful-dead-fare-thee-well-tech-pioneers/). [There were fierce documentarians](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/deadhead). There were [internet freedom advocates](https://homes.eff.org/~barlow/). 

> ...the Grateful Dead remains one of the most innovative and tech-savvy bands in pop history. Long before it became necessary (or cool) to do so, the band embraced a DIY ethos in everything from manufacturing its own gear to publishing its own music to fostering a decentralized music distribution system. The Dead’s obsession with technology was almost inseparable from the band’s psychedelic ambition and artistic independence.- *Wired* - [Call Them Hippies, But the Grateful Dead Were Tech Pioneers](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/grateful-dead-fare-thee-well-tech-pioneers/)


One band who's career has spanned the pre-internet and internet age and who's fans have created [song setlist stats API's](http://api.phish.net/) and even [statistics pages](http://www.ihoz.com/PhishStats.html) (via [Phish.net](http://phish.net)) is the band **Phish**. Coming off a long 2000's hiatus, regrouping in 2009 (to the bands' 3.0 incarnation - even the era's are marked like versions of software), the band is seeing its popularity and appreciation for performance reach near-peak 1990's levels. While its music may be divisive, sometimes due to its harmonic complexity and sometimes due to the goofiness of the lyrics and songs, no one can argue about the **fan devotion** to the band. Many fans have seen hundreds (yes 100s) of performances. In fact, via [the Phish.net API](http://api.phish.net/), fans can review and document all the shows and songs they've seen live. There is a free app [Phish On Demand](https://www.google.com/search?q=phish+on+demand&oq=phish+on+demand&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.2901j0j9&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8), that allows fans to stream **3,575 hours** of music from over **1,464 shows** that were recorded by fellow fans who lugged hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars worth of recording gear to shows, recorded the show and then distributed online, for **free**. And the band not only allowed, but encouraged this practice. 

Phish has even created their own ticketing platform where fans can enter a lottery to get premier tickets for face value. However, many of their tickets still go on sale via conventional ticket sellers [**Ticketmaster**](http://ticketmaster.com). When those tickets are sold, many end up on the **secondary ticket market** at places like [StubHub](http://stubhub.com) or on sale at [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org) with the intention of the seller, commonly called a *scalper*, to make money by raising the price of the ticket much higher than the *"face"* value of the ticket in order to make a profit on those seeking to go to the event and paying a premium to do so.  

> StubHub is an online marketplace owned by eBay, which provides services for buyers and sellers of tickets for sports, concerts, theater and other live entertainment events. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub)
